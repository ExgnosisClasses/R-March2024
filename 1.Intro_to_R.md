## What the R Ecosystem is.

R is 

- A programming language
- A statistical and data manipulation
- Development environment
    - RStudio
    - R Markdown
- Network of libraries.

## The programming language

R has a series of modules or libraries called `core R`
- These are written in C for fast execution

R has a scripting language, the `R language` that we use to write programs that call R modules and libraries

When we start R at the command line, we get a REPL - Read-Evaluate-Print Loop as shown below. Note, the way your WMs are set up you will not be able to do this, we will be using the R REPL from RStudio.

```console 
$ R

## RStudio

There are a couple of way that R is normally used.

One is the use of R notebooks in a Jupyter notebook environment.

The other is the standard GUI called RStudio.
