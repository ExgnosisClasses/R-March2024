## Class Agenda

This is the proposed outline for the class, although it may vary depending on the interests of the class as a whole. In addition, there are other topics that are more background, like the use of R notebooks, that are integrated into the class material

1. The R Ecosystem
2. R Programming Basics
3. Data Operations and Tidyverse
4. Data Analysis and Visualization 
5. Functional Programming
6. Data Cleaning
7. Statistical Models
8. Reporting in R
9. Performance Tuning
10. R and Big Data
11. R and Machine Learning

Because the class is only three days long, we will not be able to dive into and specific topic in a great deal of depth. The class is intended to introduce you to these topics so that you have a base from with to continue your self study of R

## Introductions

## Logging onto your VMs

There are several documents in the repository VM folder that will assist you. There is a VM allocation sheet also in the folder assigns students to VMs.

However, the instructor will walk you through the process before we begin the class.
